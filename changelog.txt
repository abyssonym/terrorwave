VERSION 3.8
-Fixed an error in how progression was calculated, which may dramatically impact scaling in some seeds.
-Number of enemies is now taken into account when scaling bosses.
-North Dungeon, Tower of Sacrifice, and Flower Mountain capsule locations are now considered separate checks, to be consistent with the Ruby Cave capsule location check.
-Restored compatibility with "Frue Lufia" by Artemis.
-Adjusted distribution of enemies in `monstermash` mode for more coverage of both large and small sprites.

VERSION 3.7
-Implemented two new codes: `monstermash` and `bossy`.
-`monstermash` shuffles enemies throughout dungeons. Experimental but recommended. Might make scaling more balanced.
-`bossy` makes any boss appear in any location, regardless of progression or rank. However, this game mode does not seem viable, because many bosses have attacks that deal high damage even if you scale them to very low stats. Most boss battles are decided simply by who can OHKO the other first.
-Hint Shop now gives an even distribution of hints.
-Changed up the scaling algorithm again. This time monsters are scaled by comparing them to a different enemy that fits the progression.
-Furthermore, because boss adds appear in multiple places, these monsters now scale to their lowest rank instead of the rank of their boss or home zone.

VERSION 3.6
-Enabled difficulty settings; it's just a flat multiplier for enemy stats.
-Removed Egg Dragon from the random boss pool.
-Reworked character pickups to favor waifus less often. (Note that only Tia, Guy, Selan, and Dekar can be chosen as the party leader in open world mode)
-Spell targeting is automatically limited to five enemies.
-Fixed NPC hint claiming that Zeppy Cave is a mountain.
-Implemented a logarithmic curve for enemy scaling. The default scaling factor is 0.75. This means enemies that were scaled 8x are now scaled 5x, but enemies that were scaled 2x are now scaled 1.5x. For the old behavior, input a default scaling factor of 1.0.

VERSION 3.5
-Engine no longer gives submarine.
-Added hint shop in Gruberik.
-Slightly fewer character pickups in the early game.
-Iris items can make Dankirk Dungeon a bit easier.
-Fixed bug that sometimes placed non-progression key items in red chests.
-Treasure sword chest can't contain Iris items.
-Added using the hammer to complete the Tower of Truth to the routing logic
-Fixed chest shuffling (note: only Dragon Eggs can swap with other items in open world mode)
-Turned on double scaling only in cases where the scale values are opposites.

VERSION 3.4
-Added tool quickswap patch (experimental).
-Egg Dragon no longer steals all of your money.
-NPCs no longer give hints about dragon eggs.
-Dragon eggs no longer appear in the credits.
-Made it easier to give the egg girl all of your eggs.
-New shop on Forfeit Island.
-Fixed randomizer crash when using custom randomness settings.

VERSION 3.3
-Changed some routing logic to hopefully make the endgame somewhat less linear.
-Removed glitched Pierre and Daniele formations from the boss pool.
-Added treasure sword chest to blue chest pool.
-Replaced three IP attack animations that can crash the game on large formations.

VERSION 3.2
-Fixed data allocation bug that resulted in buggy crowns in very specific scenarios.
-Allow the user to specify separate scaling settings for bosses and regular enemies with the splitscale code.

VERSION 3.1
-Fixed bug where duplicate keys could be found in their vanilla chests.
-Characters start at level 5.
-Added save points to the entrances of various dungeons.
-Added marks to areas that could have bosses, but don't.
-Egg Dragon only takes 8 eggs at a time.
-Moved the boss on the Mountain of No Return.
-Monsters are not scaled when using "vanilla" flags without the "scale" code.
-Fixed spoiler filename bug.
-Various aesthetic fixes.

VERSION 3
-Added open world mode, tons of new features
-Implemented a dynamic event script parsing and editing utility, then integrated
it into the randomizer. Unfortunately, this breaks compatibility with various
mods until their table files can be updated.

VERSION 2
-Most shop prices are rounded to 0 on even-numbered versions.
-Detailed randomness settings are available.
	Example: separate randomness for monsters and items.
-The tutorial dungeon is skippable. Reset is learned upon exiting town.
-Monster movement is randomized.
-Treasure in the Ancient Cave is randomized (including Blue Chest items).
-The Ancient Cave item bug from the original game is patched.
-An optional patch for the Ancient Cave music is available.
-New secret codes added, including a code to start the game with the airship.
-Adjust some gold to coin price conversions for rare items.
-Fixed some bugs involving IP skills not working after being shuffled.
-Characters no longer start with any initially learned magic.
-Capsule Monster skills are NOT randomized (they never actually were)
-Various mods created by Artemis are supported by the randomizer.
