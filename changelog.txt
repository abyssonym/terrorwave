VERSION 3.14
-Added a new game mode: `fourkeys`. In `fourkeys` there are only four keys.
-Capsule monster reverts to the one you selected after battle.
-Some minor adjustments to scaling; less emphasis on hp, to prevent overtuning non-boss monsters that end up in the boss pool.

VERSION 3.13
-Can no longer dive using the R button without mermaid jade.
-Enemies now attempt to scale against enemies with similar stats (no more Magma Gorem trying to become a Dark Sum'ner)
-Boss shuffling at the start of the progression is less extreme, to prevent grindy scenarios. There should still be enough variation given the number of early checks.
-Double Dekar seeds are no longer possible.
-Capsule swap no longer looks for eighth capsule monster in Jelze's hunger meter.
-Moved the Lake Cave priest to a location where he can't softlock the game.

-Made the casino and some other maps escapeable.
-Cokatoris is now correctly treated as a small monster sprite.

VERSION 3.12
-Completely overhauled monster ranking and scaling (again).
	-Scaling is now based on important attributes like HP and Agility, and not Guts.
	-Monster ranking now incorporates attack, intelligence and agility. Highlights:
		-Significantly higher: Cores, Troll, Catfish, Dark Sum'ner, Clowns
		-Significantly lower: Snow Gas, Behemoth, big slow enemies in general
	-Boss minions in large numbers are nerfed.
	-Boss minions scale up to the strength of their boss and not more.
-Bosses for split checks like Ruby Cave are scaled independently, now.
-Capsule monster master class tags in, when available.
-IP attack targeting is automatically limited to five enemies.
-Fixed a bug that caused character growths to not be randomized.
-Gratze Basement is no longer assumed to require hook. (requires arrows instead)
-Tanbel Tower is no longer assumed to require bombs.

VERSION 3.11
-Adjusted the item routing "linearity" setting to the minimum. Testing shows that this has reduced the length of key chains by 2-3 steps, on average. The previous mean for the longest chain in a seed was ~16 steps, and the new mean is ~13 steps.
-Instant death spells no longer prevent capsule monsters from tagging in.
-Added a money making NPC to the VIP room.

-Gratze and Lighthouse are no longer assumed to require wall breaking.
-Fixed a typo that would crash the randomizer if the thieves asked for a Catfish jewel.
-Restored support for "Spekkio Lufia" by Artemis.

VERSION 3.10
-Added a key shop in Agurio. The rate is three dragon eggs for one key.
-Randomized the starting tool.
-Capsule monsters get a free bonus strike when tagging in.
-Fixed the capsule tag-out experience point calculation.
-Wall breaking is now required to access the boss in Alunze Cave, for consistency with vanilla.
-Filled all empty checks.
-Dragon eggs always fill the hunger bar by half, regardless of capsule class.
-Fixed the brief palette errors when swapping capsule monsters.
-Fixed a mistake in the routing logic; it was assumed that hook is needed for Tanbel Tower.
-Changed the animation of "Frog Song", which would crash the game when used on large formations.
-Final boss no longer asks if you are ready.
-Iris items can be found in the treasure sword chest again.

VERSION 3.9
-Multiple capsule monsters can be used in one battle. Experimental; use the code `nocap` to disable this feature.
-Iris items increase the rate of feeding capsule monsters.
-Capsule monsters can eat eggs.
-Self-kill no longer counts as a victory against the Master Jelly.
-Fixed some incorrect sprites being used in `monstermash`.
-Miscellaneous aesthetic changes.
-Restored the Tanbel Inn.

VERSION 3.8
-Fixed an error in how progression was calculated, which may dramatically impact scaling in some seeds.
-Number of enemies is now taken into account when scaling bosses.
-North Dungeon, Tower of Sacrifice, and Flower Mountain capsule locations are now considered separate checks, to be consistent with the Ruby Cave capsule location check.
-Restored compatibility with "Frue Lufia" by Artemis.
-Adjusted distribution of enemies in `monstermash` mode for more coverage of both large and small sprites.

VERSION 3.7
-Implemented two new codes: `monstermash` and `bossy`.
-`monstermash` shuffles enemies throughout dungeons. Experimental but recommended. Might make scaling more balanced.
-`bossy` makes any boss appear in any location, regardless of progression or rank. However, this game mode does not seem viable, because many bosses have attacks that deal high damage even if you scale them to very low stats. Most boss battles are decided simply by who can OHKO the other first.
-Hint Shop now gives an even distribution of hints.
-Changed up the scaling algorithm again. This time monsters are scaled by comparing them to a different enemy that fits the progression.
-Furthermore, because boss adds appear in multiple places, these monsters now scale to their lowest rank instead of the rank of their boss or home zone.

VERSION 3.6
-Enabled difficulty settings; it's just a flat multiplier for enemy stats.
-Removed Egg Dragon from the random boss pool.
-Reworked character pickups to favor waifus less often. (Note that only Tia, Guy, Selan, and Dekar can be chosen as the party leader in open world mode)
-Spell targeting is automatically limited to five enemies.
-Fixed NPC hint claiming that Zeppy Cave is a mountain.
-Implemented a logarithmic curve for enemy scaling. The default scaling factor is 0.75. This means enemies that were scaled 8x are now scaled 5x, but enemies that were scaled 2x are now scaled 1.5x. For the old behavior, input a default scaling factor of 1.0.

VERSION 3.5
-Engine no longer gives submarine.
-Added hint shop in Gruberik.
-Slightly fewer character pickups in the early game.
-Iris items can make Dankirk Dungeon a bit easier.
-Fixed bug that sometimes placed non-progression key items in red chests.
-Treasure sword chest can't contain Iris items.
-Added using the hammer to complete the Tower of Truth to the routing logic
-Fixed chest shuffling (note: only Dragon Eggs can swap with other items in open world mode)
-Turned on double scaling only in cases where the scale values are opposites.

VERSION 3.4
-Added tool quickswap patch (experimental).
-Egg Dragon no longer steals all of your money.
-NPCs no longer give hints about dragon eggs.
-Dragon eggs no longer appear in the credits.
-Made it easier to give the egg girl all of your eggs.
-New shop on Forfeit Island.
-Fixed randomizer crash when using custom randomness settings.

VERSION 3.3
-Changed some routing logic to hopefully make the endgame somewhat less linear.
-Removed glitched Pierre and Daniele formations from the boss pool.
-Added treasure sword chest to blue chest pool.
-Replaced three IP attack animations that can crash the game on large formations.

VERSION 3.2
-Fixed data allocation bug that resulted in buggy crowns in very specific scenarios.
-Allow the user to specify separate scaling settings for bosses and regular enemies with the splitscale code.

VERSION 3.1

-Monsters are not scaled when using "vanilla" flags without the "scale" code.
-Fixed spoiler filename bug.
-Various aesthetic fixes.

VERSION 3
-Added open world mode, tons of new features
-Implemented a dynamic event script parsing and editing utility, then integrated
it into the randomizer. Unfortunately, this breaks compatibility with various
mods until their table files can be updated.

VERSION 2
-Most shop prices are rounded to 0 on even-numbered versions.
-Detailed randomness settings are available.
	Example: separate randomness for monsters and items.
-The tutorial dungeon is skippable. Reset is learned upon exiting town.
-Monster movement is randomized.
-Treasure in the Ancient Cave is randomized (including Blue Chest items).
-The Ancient Cave item bug from the original game is patched.
