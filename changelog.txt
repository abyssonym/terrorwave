-Spell targeting is automatically limited to five enemies.
-Fixed NPC hint claiming that Zeppy Cave is a mountain.
-Implemented a logarithmic curve for enemy scaling. The default scaling factor is 0.75. This means enemies that were scaled 8x are now scaled 5x, but enemies that were scaled 2x are now scaled 1.5x. For the old behavior, input a default scaling factor of 1.0.
