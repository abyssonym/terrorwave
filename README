--- HOW TO USE ---
Running the randomizer:
    Windows users may use the executable file, "l2_terror_wave.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 2.7.

Source rom file:
    This randomizer requires a Lufia 2 (NA-SNES) or Estopolis 2 (J-SFC) rom with the MD5 hash listed below. The "Lufia 2 Fixxxer Deluxe" version is also supported; the IPS patch file is included in this repository.
    MD5 - 6efc477d6203ed2b3b9133c1cd9e9c5d (NA)
          18567d21df6a95a7b52029d250bac721 (J)
          026b649ed316448e038349e39a6fe579 (Fixxxer)

Seed value:
    Input a seed value here, or leave it blank if you don't care.

Flags:
    c  Randomize characters.
    i  Randomize items and equipment.
    l  Randomize learnable spells.
    m  Randomize monsters.
    p  Randomize capsule monsters.
    s  Randomize shops.
    t  Randomize treasure chests.

Randomness:
    Terror Wave is the first Abyssonym randomizer to include a "randomness" option. This option controls how extreme the randomizations are. At 0.0, almost nothing will be randomized. At 1.0, enemies in the starting area will most likely have boss stats. I suggest leaving it at the default setting of 0.5 for your first run.

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized rom with the seed in the filename.
