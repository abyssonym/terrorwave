Seed value:
    Input a seed value here, or leave it blank if you don't care.

Flags:
    c  Randomize characters.
    i  Randomize items and equipment.
    l  Randomize learnable spells.
    m  Randomize monsters.
    p  Randomize capsule monsters.
    s  Randomize shops.
    t  Randomize treasure chests.

Secret Codes:
    Codes are entered in the "flags" section. The codes are:

    airship                 Start the game with the airship.
    anywhere                Equipment slots are randomized (breaks "Strongest")
    nothingpersonnelkid     Extremely aggressive enemies.

    These codes are not recommended for a first playthrough of the randomizer.

Randomness:
    Terror Wave is the first Abyssonym randomizer to include a "randomness" option. This option controls how extreme the randomizations are. At 0.0, almost nothing will be randomized. At 1.0, enemies in the starting area will most likely have boss stats. I suggest leaving it at the default setting of 0.5 for your first run.
    It is possible to use different settings for different flags. Type "custom" to enable more detailed randomness settings. This is useful, for example, when you want to find high-level gear without fighting high-level enemies.

Patches:
    The English versions of the randomizer include an optional Ancient Cave music hack. This hack will randomize the music and tileset for each floor of the Ancient Cave. Additionally, it will disable the jingle that plays whenever you open a chest.

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized rom with the seed in the filename.
