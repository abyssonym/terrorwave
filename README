Running the randomizer:

Randomness:
    Terror Wave is the first Abyssonym randomizer to include a "randomness" option. This option controls how extreme the randomizations are. At 0.0, almost nothing will be randomized. At 1.0, enemies in the starting area will most likely have boss stats. I suggest leaving it at the default setting of 0.5 for your first run.
    It is possible to use different settings for different flags. Type "custom" to enable more detailed randomness settings. This is useful, for example, when you want to find high-level gear without fighting high-level enemies.

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized rom with the seed in the filename.
