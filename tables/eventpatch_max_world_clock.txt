EVENT 89-C-5B
  0000. 08: How odd! I no longer
            feel the power of the

            happened to it?<END EVENT>

EVENT 89-C-5D
  0000. 08: The ceremony went fine,

            I wonder why I was
            so attracted to it?<END EVENT>

EVENT 89-C-61
  0000. 08: If people have time to

            a hand.<END EVENT>

EVENT 89-C-62
  0000. 08: What a shame. Prince
            Leon is leaving.<END EVENT>

EVENT 89-C-63
  0000. 08: Another Ruby Icon

            mysterious and scary.<END EVENT>
